# FiveM Launcher

This was a launcher I was developing for React Roleplay. But since the owner wants to act like a clown, I have no use for this shit anymore so enjoy.

Reality is if you're actually having to look at this code, you're not going to be able to actually make use of it as it is pretty much fully reliant on Invision Power Board & a custom IPB app that will never be released and really the time converting it you could make something better. This code is really being made public to possibly help anyone new to Electron understand how to get it to work in the context of a launcher using React for the front-end code as a few folks have been asking me. So here ya go :)

### No, you will not get support for this.
